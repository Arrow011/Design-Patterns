# Factory Design Pattern
============================================================================================================================================================
> It is a creational design pattern.
> Used when we don't want to expose the creational logic to the client and allow object creation through an interface.
> The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. 
  Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.
> When we require objects based on some conditions we can use this pattern.
